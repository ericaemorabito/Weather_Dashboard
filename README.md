# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This webpage allows a user to search a city and view the current weather and 5 day forecast. Their search history is then displayed on the page for easy reference.

- I created this project to help travelers see the current weather and future forecasts in a city of their choice.
- This project personalizes searching the weather as it saves a users history for quick, easy reference.
- This dashboard helps travelers plan their activities along with the weather conditions.
- I strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript, Day.js, and web development.
